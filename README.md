# Ownership Disciplines

My own personal list of ownership policies.

__Disclaimer__: This list is not intended to be an official, bullet-proof list
of ownership disciplines. Rather, I taking a creative approach to enumerate how
much possibilities I can, some are already existent (I will try to put the
proper reference), but the vast majority were invented here. Later, through
comparisons and trade-offs, I will try to discover great use cases for such
disciplines.

__Note__: If you have an interesting general idea for some ownership policy and
you want to give your 2 cents here through a Pull-Request, please, check
beforehand if your own idea resembles some of the ownership disciplines below. If
it indeed resembles one policy, please, improve the respective Markdown text
for that. If not, I will be very grateful if you are willing to add a new kind
of discipline. Thanks anyways. I promise to give you the due credit on the
footnotes whenever you make a contribution for given ownership discipline.
