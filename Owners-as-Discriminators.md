# Owners-as-Discriminators

This discipline can be the counterpart of accessors in some way. Identity
comparison is indeed a kind of synergy, so here it is restricted to be 
observable only by the owner. Note that discrimination/comparison involves 
two parties, and thus, the owner must own both involved objects. The identity
effect here becomes a confined capability, it also means that only the owner is
able to store such owned object in either a set or a map indexed by hash, for
instance.
