# Owners-as-Visitors

Inspired in the Visitor design pattern, in this discipline only the owners are
able to violate the encapsulation of their owned objects, that is, only the 
owner can indeed walk over all owned object's fields. This slot iteration can
be useful, for example, to inspect the contents of an object in a
graphical/interactive IDE.
