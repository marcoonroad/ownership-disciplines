# Owners-as-Events

In this discipline, Owners have the capability to change the type of their 
owned values. Such ownership reference is preserved, but both values and types
are change. This kind of Ownership Discipline is just how some Typestate
systems are made, for example, the Plaid programming language. The name
"Events" is due the analogy of FSMs on type systems: Owners are those who have
the capability to perform a state transition on type-level.
