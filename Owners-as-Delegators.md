# Owners-as-Delegators

Here, only the owner object is able to forge and share aliases for its owned
objects. Subjects which have acquired such aliases are not able to copy
them, that is, the aliases are confined and locally unique. The owner, so, is a
kind of a "alias factory", it can own how much aliases it desire, and delegate
how much it wish, but of course it must have at least one reference to copy
that owned object.

Such discipline is strongly related to the Non-Delegatable Authority pattern in
the Object-Capability Model[1].
