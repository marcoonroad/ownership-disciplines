# Owners-as-Dominators

Owners-as-Dominators is the classical and original Ownership Discipline. In 
this discipline, Ownership Domains become Ownership (Memory) Regions due the
requirement of _No incoming pointers_ inside such domain, therefore,
discarding the necessity for a Garbage Collector.

When we try to use Design Patterns such as Iterator, Memento or Observer for 
this discipline, things become really hard. New Ownership Disciplines arise to 
solve such problems through some trade-offs against this classical discipline, 
frequently discarding some properties here or reshaping other ones there.
