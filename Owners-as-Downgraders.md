# Owners-as-Downgraders

Based on Information Flow systems, this discipline states that only the owner 
can transfer ownership into a broader context, that is, the owned object
becomes more accessible through rights amplification performed by the owner.
Rights restriction/attenuation occurs when ownership is transfered down to the
Ownership Hierarchy, that is, the owner transfers some Ownership for X object
to another owned Y object, where X ≠ Y.

In this setting, every node in the Ownership Hierarchy can be seen as an
Information Flow label, where the topmost node in such hierarchy (a.k.a, world,
root, global, ...) is the _most accessible_ security label (a.k.a, public 
label).
